Python Examples to interact with ola map API : Tenet Technetronics 

To ensure that your script works as intended, you need to install the following Python libraries:

requests - for making HTTP requests to the Ola Maps API.
folium - for creating the map and adding markers.
tkinter - for creating the GUI. Note that tkinter is part of the standard Python library, so you don't need to install it separately.
webbrowser - for opening the generated HTML file in a web browser. This is also part of the standard Python library, so no separate installation is needed.
